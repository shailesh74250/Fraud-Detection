Fraud Credit Card Customer Detection

According to a recent report published by Markets & Markets the Fraud Detection and Prevention Market is going to be worth $33.19 Billion USD by 2021. This is a huge industry and the demand for advanced Deep Learning skills is only going to grow. Thatâ€™s why we have included this case study in the course.  

Unsupervised Deep Learning Models. The business challenge here is about detecting fraud in credit card applications. Creating a Deep Learning model for a bank and Dataset that contains information on customers applying for an advanced credit card. 

This is the data that customers provided when filling the application form. Detect potential fraud within these applications. That means that by the end of the challenge, literally come up with an explicit list of customers who potentially cheated on their applications.
